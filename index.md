This site is [a workbook](workbook/index) on understanding the Eurocentric (Western) institutions that shape too much of the world and changing them to implement a better future than the one we seem to be headed towards.

I am writing it as a record of my evolving opinions on our institutions such a countries, democracy and the economy, together with their components such as media, governments and education and health systems.

My opinions evolve as a result of writing it, on the principle of “How do I know what I think until I see what I write”[^fn1] and as a result of reading history, the news and many other sources.

I am updating this web version as I go, a few weeks behind updating my own version, just to reduce frequency of changes: I seem to have a lot of erroneous or at least confused thinking in my head.

As I update the book I sometimes illustrate my work in the form of a [blog](blog), which will have more topical thoughts about why I made some major change or relating it to the news of the day. It will also include philosophical thoughts, miscellaneous STEM thoughts and perhaps some photos I find  interesting, usually from around my home, currently a log house in the woods.

I am also hoping that perhaps someone else will have some interest in following along, both to learn something and perhaps offer some helpful guidance or criticism. Feel free to give suggestions on this, too.

The [About me](aboutme) section is intended to give some sense of who I am so that you know a little about why I have the perspectives that I do. I’m not sure that I will get round to a lot of detail, but I will probably put some anecdotes in the blog.

I welcome constructive input. I haven’t yet figured out how to add comments directly on this site — not a technical issue, each option has drawbacks ― so for now, please respond to my Twitter or Mastodon posts as I add each chapter. I realise not everyone uses these sites or want to have an account, but other services like Disqus have their own drawbacks. Feel free to give suggestions on this, too.
